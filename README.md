# 2048-GAME
This is a 2048 Game clone built using [technology stack, e.g., JavaScript, React, Python, etc.]. The game involves combining tiles of the same value by sliding them in one of four directions (up, down, left, or right). When two tiles of the same number collide, they merge into a new tile with a value equal to the sum of the two tiles. The objective of the game is to create a tile with the number 2048.
